## 11. Your Data Protection Rights under the California Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)

CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.

According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:

1. Users can visit our site anonymously
2. Our Privacy Policy link includes the word “Privacy”, and can easily be found on the home page of our website
3. Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page
4. Users are able to change their personal information by emailing us at privacy[at]svrjs[dot]org

## 12. Your Data Protection Rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)

If you are a California resident, you are entitled to learn what data we collect about you, ask to delete your data, and not to sell (share) it. To exercise your data protection rights, you can make certain requests and ask us:

### What personal information we have about you. If you make this request, we will return to you:

1. The categories of personal information we have collected about you
2. The categories of sources from which we collect your personal information
3. The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information
4. The categories of third parties with whom we share personal information
5. The specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you
6. A list of categories of personal information that we have sold, along with the category of any other company we sold it to. If we have not sold your personal information, we will inform you of that fact
7. A list of categories of personal information that we have disclosed for a business purpose, along with the category of any other company we shared it with

Please note, you are entitled to ask us to provide you with this information up to two times in a rolling twelve-month period. When you make this request, the information provided may be limited to the personal information we collected about you in the previous 12 months.

- **To delete your personal information.** If you make this request, we will delete the personal information we hold about you as of the date of your request from our records and direct any service providers to do the same. In some cases, deletion may be accomplished through de-identification of the information. If you choose to delete your personal information, you may not be able to use certain functions that require your personal information to operate.
- **To stop selling your personal information.** We don’t sell or rent your personal information to any third parties for any purpose. We do not sell your personal information for monetary consideration. However, under some circumstances, a transfer of personal information to a third party, or within our family of companies, without monetary consideration may be considered a “sale” under California law. You are the only owner of your Personal Data and can request disclosure or deletion at any time.

If you submit a request to stop selling your personal information, we will stop making such transfers.

Please note, if you ask us to delete or stop selling your data, it may impact your experience with us, and you may not be able to participate in certain programs or membership services which require the usage of your personal information to function. But in no circumstances, we will discriminate against you for exercising your rights.

To exercise your California data protection rights described above, please send your request(s) by email: privacy[at]svrjs[dot]org.

Your data protection rights, described above, are covered by the CCPA, short for the California Consumer Privacy Act. To find out more, visit the official California Legislative Information website. The CCPA took effect on 01.01.2020.

## 13. Service Providers

We may employ third-party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service (“Service Providers”), provide Service on our behalf, perform Service-related services, or assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.

These third parties have access to your Personal Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.

## 14. Analytics

We are using a self-hosted Matomo instance at analytics.svrjs.org to monitor and analyze the use of our Service.

You may choose to prevent this website from aggregating and analyzing the actions you take here. Doing so will protect your privacy, but will also prevent the owner from learning from your actions and creating a better experience for you and other users.

To make that choice, please click below to receive an opt-out cookie.

export const vulnerabilities = `

### Fixed in SVR.JS 3.15.0 and in SVR.JS 3.14.16 LTS
- An attacker could send a HTTP forward proxy request with malformed URL not using CONNECT method to possibly crash the server.

### Fixed in SVR.JS 3.13.0 and in SVR.JS 3.4.41 LTS
- An attacker could use user name with newlines on HTTP authentication to inject false log entries. (introduced in SVR.JS 3.0.0)
- An attacker could install problematic SVR.JS mod with newlines in its filename to inject false log entries. (introduced in SVR.JS 3.0.0)

### Fixed in SVR.JS 3.12.1 and in SVR.JS 3.4.39 LTS
- An attacker could inject HTML code into the \`extName\` parameter of the \`callServerError\` method to perform XSS attack.
- An attacker could inject HTML code into the \`serverAdministratorEmail\` config.json property and cause the server to return 500, 502, 503, 504, 506 or 509 error code using a default error page or an error page with a \`{contact}\` placeholder to perform XSS attack.

### Fixed in SVR.JS 3.10.2
- SVR.JS mods and server-side JavaScript were executed in the wrong order. So the attacker could bypass access controls if one of the mods had them, but the other one allowed browsing sensitive information. (introduced in SVR.JS 3.9.3; not present in LTS)

### Fixed in SVR.JS 3.9.6 and in SVR.JS 3.4.34 LTS
- An attacker could use URL beginning with “/temp/“ to leak information from temp directory in SVR.JS installation directory (includes source code through hidden \`.modloader_w12345\` and \`.serverSideScript_w12345.js\`), if web root is in SVR.JS installation directory. View the security advisory

### Fixed in SVR.JS 3.9.3 and in SVR.JS 3.4.31 LTS
- An attacker could use request URL that begins with “http://“ or with “https://“ (instead of one that begins with “/“) to bypass all access controls (including HTTP authentication) in affected versions that use SVR.JS mods or server-side JavaScript not using \`href\` or \`uobject.pathname\` properties in at least one of path checks. View the security advisory

### Fixed in SVR.JS 3.9.2 and in SVR.JS 3.4.30 LTS
- Affected SVR.JS versions failed to protect the \`req.url\` property in SVR.JS mods and server-side JavaScript from path traversal because they didn’t detect partial URL sanitation done by WHATWG URL parser and they didn’t apply sanitations back to the \`req.url\` property. (introduced in SVR.JS 3.3.1) View the security advisory

### Fixed in SVR.JS 3.9.0 and in SVR.JS 3.4.28 LTS
- An attacker could put invalid \`X-Forwarded-For\` header value in order to possibly cause problems with web application. (when enableIPSpoofing was enabled)

### Fixed in SVR.JS 3.7.5
- Block list didn’t work, and thus attackers could bypass blocks. (introduced in SVR.JS 3.5.0; not present in LTS)

### Fixed in SVR.JS 3.5.6 and in SVR.JS 3.4.16 LTS
- An attacker could use “…” to traverse directories, while SVR.JS is running on Windows. (in web apps, less probable in SVR.JS itself, since Node.JS itself reports that “…” doesn’t exist)

### Fixed in SVR.JS 3.3.1
- An attacker could use request URL, that begins with “http://“ or with “https://“ to bypass all access controls in affected versions, that use SVR.JS mods or server-side JavaScript.

### Fixed in SVR.JS 3.3.0
- Non-standard codes didn’t work, and thus attackers could bypass HTTP authentication. (introduced in SVR.JS 3.2.1)

### Fixed in SVR.JS 3.2.1
- An attacker could access directory listing of directory above web root using “/..” path. (introduced in SVR.JS 3.0.0 and SVR.JS 2.1.3)

### Fixed in SVR.JS 3.1.2
- If SVR.JS script is above (not on) web root directory, then config.json and other sensitive files can be easily accessed. (through security misconfiguration; introduced in SVR.JS 3.0.0)

### Fixed in SVR.JS 3.0.0
- There was a XSS bug in host name indication in default error pages.

### Fixed in SVR.JS 3.0.0 and SVR.JS 2.1.4
- An attacker could append “%00” to the URL in order to bypass access restrictions when SVR.JS is running on Bun.
- An attacker could use encoded characters to bypass access restrictions.
- Fixed access control bypass vulnerability when the server is running on Windows.

### Fixed in SVR.JS 3.0.0 and SVR.JS 2.1.3
- Server crashed on malformed URL.
- Path traversal was possible with files.
- Fixed access control bypass vulnerability when the server is running on Windows (partial fix).

### Fixed in SVR.JS 2.1.1
- An attacker could use directory listing to access secret files (through path traversal).

## easy-waf integration

### Fixed in easy-waf integration 1.2.4
- An attacker could send a very small chunk of the POST request body (which will not trigger WAF) before the payload to bypass the WAF.

### Fixed in easy-waf integration 1.2.1
- An attacker could access the resource on the server with poorly written SVR.JS mod or server-side JavaScript (that normally would invoke 500 Internal Server Error) to crash the server.

## RedBrick

### Fixed in RedBrick 2.5.4
- An attacker could add HTTP authentication header to the HTTP request when not required to enable web application functionality normally disabled on unauthenticated requests. View the security advisory

### Fixed in RedBrick 2.3.3
- An attacker could use “CGI-BIN” instead of “cgi-bin” to leak source code, while SVR.JS with RedBrick is running on Windows. View the security advisory
- An attacker could leak RedBrick interpreter settings, while SVR.JS with RedBrick is running on Windows. View the security advisory

## reverse-proxy-mod

### Fixed in reverse-proxy-mod 1.1.2
